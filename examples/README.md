# Examples

This directory contains example projects which correspond to the examples in RATapi.
They can all be loaded with the RasCAL-2 project load dialog.

To (re-)create the examples, run `make_examples.py` in this directory.

The one exceptional project is the folder `rascal1_example`, which contains a .mat
file for a RasCAL-1 project. This can be loaded using the import RasCAL-1 project dialog.
