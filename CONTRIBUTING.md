Contributing to RasCAL-2
========================
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the RasCAL2 project by either opening an issue (please check that the 
issue has not been reported already) or submitting a pull request.

Create Developer Environment
----------------------------
First begin by creating a fork of the RasCAL-2 repo, then clone the fork

    git clone https://github.com/<username>/RasCAL-2.git
    cd RasCAL-2

We recommend using anaconda python distribution  for development, a new virtual environment should be 
created to isolate dependencies. For Windows, first download and install [Microsoft Visual C++](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). Then run the following

    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate rascal2

And finally create a separate branch to begin work

    git switch -c new-feature

Once complete submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) via GitHub. 
Ensure to rebase your branch to include the latest changes on your branch and resolve possible merge conflicts.

Unit-testing and coverage
-------------------------
RasCAL-2 uses the **pytest** module for testing. Proper documentation and unit tests are highly recommended.

To install pytest use

    pip install pytest pytest-cov

Run the tests and generate a coverage report with

    pytest tests --cov=rascal2

The coverage report can be saved to the directory htmlcov by running the tests with

    pytest tests --cov-report html --cov=rascal2

For information on other coverage report formats, see https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reporting.html

Documentation
-------------
* The documentation will be hosted on GitHub pages.
* It will be written in reStructuredText format and built via Sphinx.

Style guidelines
----------------
* Docstrings should be written in the numpydoc format.
* `ruff format` must be used to format code.
* Method names should be written in snake case (like_this). If you are overriding a PyQt6 method,
  add it to `extend-ignore-names` in the section `[tool.ruff.lint.pep8-naming]` in the pyproject.toml.

How to build the executable
---------------------------
This script will create the executable for the software in the **packaging/bundle** folder.

    cd packaging
    python build_exe.py

How to build the Installer
--------------------------
### Windows
1. [NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)  is required to build the Windows installer, this can be installed from Conda along with other essential  
plugins
   
        conda install -c nsis nsis=3.* accesscontrol
    
2. After installing NSIS, build the executable then run the build script **packaging/windows/build_installer.nsi**.

        cd packaging/
        python build_exe.py
        makensis windows/build_installer.nsi
      
### Linux
1. The installer can be built by running the **packaging/linux/build_installer.sh** bash script. The script requires 
   that [makeself](https://makeself.io/) (version 2.4.0) is installed on the machine.

        > ./build_installer.sh --remote --tag v1.0.0

   or
   
        > ./build_installer.sh --local ../.. --tag v1.0.0
   
   The script above will download RasCAL-2 with tag "v1.0.0" from the remote or clone a local git repo (git required), 
   download miniconda and required pip packages, then  bundle them all into a makeself archive (*.run) which serves 
   as the installer. The installer would be created in the **packaging/linux** folder. If the tag option is omitted, 
   the script will grab the latest version of RasCAL. The build script requires Matlab 2023a to build an installer with 
   Matlab support, to build an installer without Matlab, run as shown below
   
       > ./build_installer.sh --remote --nomatlab
